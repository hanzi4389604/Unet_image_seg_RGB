# Unet_image_seg_RGB

This repository is to learn and practice image segmentation for plant seeds and pathogen symptoms. However, object segmentation may not good engough for my purpose, instance segmentation such as Mask-RCNN might be good for this purpose. Nevertheless, the model was trained to see how it works. 

Here is the segmentation effect after 500 epoches training.
For each image set, the first is the original image, the 2nd is the annotation, the 3rd is the segmented with the model.
